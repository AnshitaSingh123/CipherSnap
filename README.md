**Summary of Image Encryption Decryption Project**  

**Overview**:  
This project is an image processing application built with **Python**, utilizing **Tkinter GUI** and **OpenCV** libraries to enable image encryption and decryption. It allows users to encrypt images into grayscale format, decrypt them back to their original state, and save the processed images locally.

### **Key Features**:
1. **Image Encryption/Decryption**: Encrypts selected images to grayscale and allows decryption back to the original format.  
2. **GUI Interface**: Built with **Tkinter**, offering user-friendly buttons for selecting, encrypting, decrypting, saving, resetting, and exiting.  
3. **File Handling**: Supports saving edited images to any directory and resetting them to the original format.  
4. **Modular Tools**: Uses libraries such as **NumPy**, **PIL (Pillow)**, and **OpenCV** for processing and visualizing images.

### **Tech Stack**:
- **Python 3**  
- Libraries: **Tkinter**, **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, **PIL**  
- **Random** and **OS** modules for file handling

### **Usage Instructions**:
1. Install required libraries (**Tkinter**, **PIL**, **OpenCV**, **NumPy**) using pip.  
2. Run `image_encryption_decryption.py`.  
3. Use the GUI to load an image, perform encryption/decryption, save changes, or reset to the original.  

**Purpose**: Ensures image security by providing encryption for sensitive images and the ability to decrypt them when needed.
